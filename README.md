a database to store the feedback, and a reporting system that allows the company to analyze the feedback received.

The system is designed to help the company understand its customers better and to improve the quality of its products and services.
By analyzing the feedback received, the company can identify areas that require improvement and take necessary actions 
to improve customer satisfaction.

and effectively. It helps to enhance the customer experience and build stronger relationships with customers.
